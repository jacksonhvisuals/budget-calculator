> [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jacksonhvisuals/simplicity.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jacksonhvisuals/simplicity) > ![Contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-orange.svg) > [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache--2.0-blue.svg)](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)

## How to use Simplicity

Using the app is easy. Simply edit the total budget amount at the top of the app, and then create categories as needed. You can easily copy the calculated amounts (to paste in another app, such as [YNAB](https://youneedabudget.com)) by clicking on them.

## How to build Simplicity

Clone the repo to your computer, run `npm i`, and follow that up with `npm run`.

## Resources

Without [Codecademy's incredible React course](https://www.codecademy.com/pro/intensive/build-frontend-web-apps-from-scratch), I would have had no idea how to build Simplicity.
